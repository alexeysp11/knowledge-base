# Stored procedures 

Temporary tables are often used to store intermediate calculations in a complex series of CREATE or UPDATE queries that produce some sort of analysis result. An example might be the creation of summary tables for an OLAP database.

Temporary tables are also sometimes used to increase performance, in certain situations.

In general, temporary tables are a way to store datasets (generally the result of a complex query) that need to be used further. Many times you can achieve this using subquery. But subquery drags performance. Temp tables help in improving performance by narrowing down the dataset.

Suppose you have a query that needs to join 7â€“8 tables. Then it's advisable to join the tables having the most minor rows and store their output in the temp table and then join this temp table to other more extensive tables.

Stored procedures provide a way to encapsulate and organize complex SQL queries and logic on the database server. They can improve performance by reducing network traffic and optimizing query execution plans. Additionally, stored procedures can enhance security by controlling access to data and preventing SQL injection attacks.

In the context of using temporary tables, stored procedures can be used to create and manipulate temporary tables as part of a series of complex queries. By encapsulating these operations within a stored procedure, it can improve code organization, reusability, and maintainability. The use of temporary tables within stored procedures can help improve performance by reducing the need for repetitive subqueries and optimizing query execution.
