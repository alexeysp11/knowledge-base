# indexes

[English](indexes.md) | [Русский](indexes.ru.md)

An index in a database is a data structure that allows you to quickly find the required records in a table. It is created based on one or more table fields and contains links to the corresponding records. Indexes are needed to speed up the execution of database queries.

## Index types

There are several types of indexes in the database:
- Regular index (B-tree) is the most common type of index, which is created on one or more fields of a table and is used to speed up the search for records.
- Unique index - similar to a regular index, but guarantees the uniqueness of the values in the indexed fields.
- Full-text index - used to search text data using keywords.
- Geographic index - used to search for geographic objects by coordinates.
- Bit index - used to search for records by bit field values.

To search for data by index, various algorithms are used, such as B-tree, Hash, Bitmap, etc.

It is best to index fields that are frequently used in `WHERE`, `JOIN` and `ORDER BY` conditions. These are usually fields that have unique or nearly unique values, such as IDs, dates, names, etc.

Choosing a particular type of index for a particular table depends on many factors such as the size of the table, the number of records, the types of queries that will be executed, etc.

### Unique indexes

Advantages of unique indexes:
- Guarantees the uniqueness of values in indexed fields.
- Allows you to quickly find records by unique values.

Disadvantages of unique indexes:
- They take up more space in the database due to additional verification of the uniqueness of values.
- May slow down the processes of adding, updating and deleting data.

## Restrictions

### When using indexes

Limits are placed on the number of indexes in a table, since each index takes up a certain amount of space in the database and slows down the processes of adding, updating and deleting data. Additionally, indexes can slow down data retrieval processes if they are not optimized correctly.

The following problems may occur when using indexes:
- Increasing the size of the database due to the creation of indexes.
- Slowing down the processes of adding, updating and deleting data due to the need to update indexes.
- Inefficient use of indexes due to improper query optimization.
- Limits on the number of indexes in the table.
- Increased query execution time due to a large number of indexes.
#### Limits on the number of indexes

In PostgreSQL, you cannot set a limit on the number of indexes per table and database.
To find out if there is a limit on the number of indexes for a table and database, you need to check the PostgreSQL documentation and configuration files.

To work around the issue of limiting the number of indexes on a table, you can use combination indexes or functional indexes.
To get around the problem of limiting the number of indexes for a database, you can use partitioning or horizontal sharding.

#### Inefficient use of indexes due to improper query optimization

To prevent the problem of inefficient use of indexes due to poor query optimization, you need to design indexes and optimize queries correctly.

### When updating or deleting data

The database may need to delete old data, for example, to free up hard disk space or to comply with data storage requirements.

When updating or deleting data from a table with an index, the following problems may occur:
- Slowdown of processes due to the need to update indexes.
- Violation of data integrity due to deletion of records that are referenced by other records.
- Inefficient use of indexes due to improper query optimization.

To free up hard disk space to optimize database performance without compromising data integrity by deleting records that are referenced by other records, you can use cascading deletes or temporary tables.

### In distributed systems

The following problems may arise when working with indexes in distributed systems:
- Synchronization of indexes between distributed system nodes.
- Slowdown of processes due to a large number of requests to remote nodes.
- Inefficient use of indexes due to different types of databases on different nodes.

To ensure synchronization of indexes between nodes in a distributed system, you can use data replication or data synchronization mechanisms.

## Monitoring

### Problems when working with large amounts of data

When working with large amounts of data in a database, the following problems may arise:
- Slowdown of processes due to large amounts of data.
- Inefficient use of indexes due to large amounts of data.
- Problems with data storage and backup.

To solve the problem of inefficient use of indexes due to a large amount of data, you can use partial index, sharding, highly selective indexes, indexes on frequently used queries, indexes on frequently updated columns, etc.

To store and back up data in PostgreSQL, you can use backup mechanisms such as `pg_dump` and `pg_basebackup`, as well as data replication.

### Methods for monitoring and optimizing indexes

The following methods can be used to monitor and optimize indexes in a database:
- Analyze queries and identify ineffective queries.
- Using database performance monitoring tools such as SQL Server Profiler, Oracle Enterprise Manager, MySQL Workbench, etc.
- Analyze index statistics and identify unused or duplicate indexes.
- Using query performance analysis tools such as SQL Query Analyzer, Explain Plan, etc.

### Tools for analyzing query performance

You can use the following tools to analyze query performance:
- SQL Server Management Studio.
- Oracle Enterprise Manager.
- MySQL Workbench.
- PostgreSQL pgAdmin.
- MongoDB Compass.

## Entity Framework

There are several approaches you can use to add indexes when using the Entity Framework in C#:
- Creating indexes manually using SQL scripts.
- Using the `[Index]` and `[Index("index_name")]` attributes to define indexes in data model code.
- Use [Fluent API](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/ef6/modeling/code-first/fluent/types-and-properties) to define indexes in the context of the data. For example, `modelBuilder.Entity<Entity>().HasIndex(e => e.PropertyName)`.
- Using migrations to create indexes. To do this, you need to create a new migration and add a call to the CreateIndex method in the Up() method.

Here are some other possible solutions to the problem of adding indexes when using Entity Framework:
- Using an ORM that supports automatic index creation (for example, NHibernate or Dapper).
- Using special libraries to manage indexes in the database (for example, DbUp or FluentMigrator).
- Using scripts to automatically create indexes based on analysis of database queries.
- Using special tools to monitor and optimize database performance (for example, SQL Server Management Studio or Oracle Enterprise Manager).
- Using special tools for automatic query optimization and index creation (for example, SQL Server Query Store or Oracle SQL Tuning Advisor).
